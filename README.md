## Jupyter-notebooks:

# 1. A/B Testing of themes using a dataset from :
 https://statso.io/light-theme-and-dark-theme-case-study/

# 2. Recession Analysis 
The severity of a recession refers to the extent to which the economy contracts during a recession. A severe recession involves a deeper and more prolonged decline in economic activity, resulting in negative effects on employment, incomes, and other economic indicators.

# 3. Calculate dynamic pricing strategy for rides trips.
 In a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.

# 4. Insights on Oil Consumption worldwide

# 5. Price Optimization using python 
   The aim in a price optimization project is to find the most optimal price point for a product or service.
